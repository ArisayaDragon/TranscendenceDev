	gData is a list of paneDesc. Each paneDesc has the following fields:

				of actions for this pane.

				advance to the next pane. This is the label for the action.

	An actionDesc structure has the following fields:
	
		label: The label for the action. This is required.
		
		nextPane: The next pane to advance to, by ID. If this value is Nil, then
				we exit the screen. If this is the special value 'forceUndock
