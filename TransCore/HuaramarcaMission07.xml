			<Text id="GoodBye">
				Apotamo leads you to the airlock.

				"Our debt to you is boundless. I regret we have not made your path any easier.
				May the blessings of the Light shine before you!"
			</Text>
			<Text id="Revelation">
				"The Light brought me a dream, not long after you arrived. I dreamt
				that I floated above all the stars of Humanity. I saw the fortresses
				of the Huari and the stations of the Commonwealth and the evil citadels
				of the Sung. I even saw Earth and the red-green world of Ares Prime."

				"But every world I saw and every place I looked was devoid of life. Only
				the ruins and ashes of our lives remained. It was as if a blinding fire
				had cleansed the universe of us and all our works."
			</Text>
			<Text id="Revelation2">
				Apotamo looks directly in your eyes. You see in his face a mixture of
				awe and horror.

				"No," he says slowly, "That's what will happen if you succeed."
			</Text>
			<Text id="Welcome">
				Apotamo greets you at the door of the Grand Hall.

				"Welcome back, %name%! Take your ease here before you continue on
				your arduous journey."
