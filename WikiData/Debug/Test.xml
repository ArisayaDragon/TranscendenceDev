      <text xml:space="preserve">The Commonwealth was founded in 2116 by citizens of the [[NEOs]], Earth-orbiting, and Lunar colonies, after [[Earth]] enforced bans on human germ-line genetic engineering. In the next few centuries, the Commonwealth became the most powerful human sovereign and was instrumental in the fight against the [[Ares Sect]].

The Commonwealth is a federal system in which individual worlds and stations run their own internal affairs. A [[Commonwealth Parliament]] decides inter-station issues including the regulation of commerce, the relationship with other sovereigns, and defense against pirates and other threats to commerce (through the [[Commonwealth Militia]]).

The only institution not controlled by Parliament is the military. The military forces of the Commonwealth are controlled by the [[Council of Lords]], a group of seventeen people elected by the Parliament.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The planet Earth, the third planet in the [[Sol system]], is the cradle of humanity and the standard against which all other worlds are measured. All humans and [[neo-humans]] can trace their ancestry back to Earth and the history of human life on Earth is far longer than our history among the stars.

After the rise of the [[Commonwealth]] and the [[Corporate Hierarchy]] and especially after the [[Syrtis War]], Earth decreased in importance and the [[St. Katharine's Star System]] is now considered to be the capital of humanity. Nevertheless, Earth remains an important world and the fashions, customs, and tastes of Old Earth are eagerly sought out by the citizens of the Commonwealth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans have been improving themselves physically and mentally since the dawn of civilization, but the widespread use of genetic modification in the twenty-second century makes it difficult to speak of a single &quot;human race&quot;. Humans can be categorized by their relationship to augmentations and enhancements (in increasing order of technological sophistication):

* [[Zoanthropes]] have jettisoned all higher brain functions and act only on instinct.
* [[Simples]] have radically altered their brains to remove all violent and unpleasant emotions.
* [[Luddites]] eschew all technology developed after the twenty-first century.
* [[Pure humans]] use modern technology but refuse all kinds of augmentation or enhancement.
* [[Augmented humans]] use technology to improve themselves but avoid all germ-line genetic modifications.
* [[Enhanced humans]] employ minor germ-line genetic modifications to improve themselves.
* [[Neo-humans]] have radically changed their genome and no longer appear or behave completely human.

There are two branches that split off from the Jiang's Star to Heretic route. The first leads to the systems of the [[Ranx Empire]] while the second leads to the [[Ares]] homeworld in [[Aeria]].

Because of the distance and the dangers of traveling through the [[Ungoverned Territories]], the Outer Realm remains partly unexplored by the [[Commonwealth]]. [[Ringers]] are often found in Outer Realm systems, but it is not known how far their influence reaches. The [[Ranx Empire]] and the [[Teraton Host]] are also found in the Outer Realm.

The Commonwealth and the [[Ares Orthodoxy]] have been fighting a prolonged [[Ares War|war]] in the Outer Realm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Saint Katharine's Star is a system discovered in 2124 by the [[Commonwealth]] explorer ship Independence. The third planet in the system, [[Incandescent]], is one of the only known biosphere planets in [[Human Space]].

The Saint Katharine system was originally known as the New Sun system, but was renamed in 2184.

== Planets ==
The closest planet to St. Katharine’s Star is known as [[Redglow]]. It is a rocky, cratered world with very little water. A stargate in orbit around this world leads to the [[Ungoverned Territories]].

[[Radiant]], a desert world, is the next planet out.

The third planet is [[Incandescent]], now the capital of the Commonwealth.

The fourth planet is a gas giant known as [[Majestic]], which has two large moons.

The fifth planet is an icy world called [[Fulgent]]. A stargate here leads to the [[New Beyond]].

The sixth and outermost planet is known as [[Tenebrous]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Abbasid Survivalists are followers of al-Hakim, who prophesized in 2230 that a Flame War would destroy most of humanity, leaving only the faithful to inherit the galaxy. Many saw his prophesies come true with the start of the [[Syrtis War]] and millions were convinced to retreat to fortified outposts, where they awaited the inevitable.

After the war, many followers deserted the faith, but a few persisted in their beliefs. Today, Abbasid Survivalists continue to exist, choosing well-defended, deep-space outposts for their retreats. They attack anyone who approaches.

== Abbasid Thanograms ==
These rare and precious objects are optical neural networks initialized from the cerebral patterns of one or more Scholars of Abbasid. The legal, ethical, and moral knowledge of the Abbasid Survivalists is contained and interpreted by these constructs.

It is rumored that the thanogram of al-Hakim survives somewhere in [[Human Space]], but none have been able to find it.

      <comment>/* History */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Ranx Empire is a human sovereign populating the [[Outer Realm]] near and around the [[Anhalt]] system.

== History ==
Human colonists from [[St. Katharine's Star]] and [[Earth]] settled the Outer Realm starting in the late 2100's. An economy based on [[pteracnium]] and [[ithalium]] ore supported a large number of stations, some associated with the Commonwealth, others of independent alignment.

From the start there were tensions between human and neo-human populations. The [[Ringers]], who began settlement of the Outer Realm in 2183, were better adapted to space and often found and exploited the richest fields of ore. Nevertheless, the vastness of the region prevented any serious conflicts.

In the second half of the 23rd century, after the end of the [[Syrtis War]] and the devastation of [[Mars]], [[Ares]] refugees poured in to the Outer Realm looking for a new home. Around the same time, the unpredictable [[Teratons]], a genetic off-shoot of the Ringers, began aggressively building their nests.

At first human colonists looked to the Commonwealth to help them keep out neo-human invaders, but the government on [[New Victoria]] was too exhausted from war and relied on the Ringers to protect their interests.

In 2276, [[Karin Nordlin]], a former mining captain from [[Anhalt]], formed the Ranx Coalition as a way to unite the human stations. Nordlin's aims were modest at first, hoping only to coordinate Commonwealth defenses against neo-human encroachment on Ranx asteroid fields. But as the movement grew, and Nordlin's followers increased, she declared sovereignty on behalf of the stations that she represented.

In the early 2300's, Karin's son [[Linus Nordlin]] was elected First Minister of the Ranx Sovereignty. A fall in the price of ithalium had devastated the economy of the Outer Realm and Nordlin and his followers felt that unfair competition from Ringers and the Ares Orthodoxy were to blame. They had a particular distate for the Ringers, who used zoanthrope [[Ferians]] to mine their asteroid fields, a practice that the Ranx equated with slave labor.

In 2311 an incident in a disputed asteroid field ignited a call to armed resistance among the Ranx. Nordlin took the opportunity to consolidate his power and shed some of the parliamentary constraints that were originally created by his mother. The Ranx began construction of a large fleet to protect their interests.

Although the Ranx fleet never challenged Ringer homes directly, it threatened enough asteroid fields that they soon became uneconomical for the Ringers to hold on to. By 2340, the Ranx had expanded their sphere of influence to a couple of the systems around Anhalt and their fortresses and outposts began appearing as far away as [[Saurus Mons]].

The last few vestiges of a parliamentary democracy were discarded by Linus Nordlin's successor, [[Paulina Ragnar]]. Ragnar, once a captain in the Ranx fleet, consolidated control of the military and purged the government of dissent. Even some members of Nordlin's family were caught up in the purge.

Another casualty of Ragnar's ascension was [[Greger Kalmar]], an engineer who worked on many of the Ranx fleet's original weapons, and who was suspected of collaborating with people loyal to the Nordlin family. He fled the Empire before an arrest order could be issued and started a new home with his family in [[Eta Ceti]]. Kalmar later worked for [[Rasiermesser]] and became Chief Scientist, a position that was later assumed by his even more brilliant son, [[Dvalin]].

In the late 2300's, the Ranx Empire expanded under Paulina Ragnar, but there was constant tension with Ringers, Teratons, and the Ares Orthodoxy.

Around the same time, exiles who were banished by Ragnar formed a dissident group under [[Gabriel Nordlin]], a nephew of Linus. Though small in number and only recently organized, this group seeks to oust Ragnar from the Imperial City. So far, however, the Ranx Empire does not seem overly concerned with them. 

In recent years there have been rumors of secret ship building at Anhalt and speculation that the Ranx may be preparing for another wave of expansion.

== Notes ==
* Origin: Outcompeted by the Ringers? Perhaps Ferians were created by the Ranx (as slaves) until the Ringers rescued them?
* Goals: The glory of the empire? To expand the realm? To bring order to their region? They are the only humans left in the Outer Realm--the other sovereigns (Ares, Ringers, Teratons) are neo-humans. Perhaps the wish to reclaim the Outer Realm on behalf of humans--whom they represent. Perhaps they admire the Commonwealth (and particularly Conrad Decker), though they are enemies.
* Friends: Ares?
* Enemies: Ringers, Commonwealth.
* What is their relationship to the Ares Orthodoxy? (They are neutral in-game).
* What is their relationship to Ringers? (They are enemies in-game).
* What is their relationship to Teratons? (They are neutral in-game).
* What is their relationship to Ferians? (They are neutral in-game).

== Mysteries ==
* The Ranx use Akan weapons. What is their relationship to [[Rasiermesser]] and to [[Dvalin]]? Perhaps the key scientists of Rasiermesser defected from the Ranx Empire?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sapiens Preservation Society started in the twenty-second century as a group opposed to germ-line genetic engineering. Over the centuries, however, this group has turned into a destructive cult bent on eradicating all humans that deviate from the ancestral gene pool.

Sapiens are a small group, relegated to the most inhospitable systems, but they sometimes deal with anarchists and many of their ship designs are based on Freeworlds Shipyard designs.
Sapiens use radiation and other biohazards as their weapon of choice against the “devolved”.

== Environment ==
Sapiens desire to place their stations in the life zone of the system. Unfortunately, they are a small group and are seldom powerful enough to occupy such prime real estate, so they often end up with whatever room they can get in some asteroid field or orbiting a barren world at the edge of the system.

Even in the [[Sol system]], where they are most powerful, Sapiens are reduced to a single North Atlantic island on Earth and a handful of asteroid colonies.

== Leadership ==
Every Sapiens station is populated by a single “clan” (sometimes a few clans connected by intermarriage). Within each clan, leadership passes from parent to child (or to cousins, if a leader has no surviving children).

The Mother Clan is the original Sapiens clan that began the movement on Earth. The Mother Clan is led by Angela G. K. Concord, who is a direct descendant of Karen Angela Concord, the movement’s founder.

The Mother Clan does not have formal authority over the other clans, but as the wealthiest clan, it does give money to the other clans and thus influences them indirectly.

== Goals &amp; Desires ==
The Sapiens began as a movement opposed to germ-line genetic modification, but now they seek nothing less than the extermination of any “impure” humans.

On Earth, the movement downplays these beliefs and does not actively attack other races. But in Commonwealth space, more radical clans attack anyone who approaches.

== Threats &amp; Fears ==
Sapiens believe that all of the problems of Humanity are caused by ignoring the true nature of being human. They fear the corruption of nature embodied in genetic engineering.

== Powers ==
Though Sapiens refuse to use any kind of human genetic technology, they adopt and use any other kind of technology (including, occasionally, genetic engineering of non-human creatures).

Sapiens have particular mastery of nuclear technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The UAS is a Terran sovereign that controls most of the African continent of [[Earth]] and many of the [[near-Earth asteroids]].

The UAS often finds itself at odds with the [[Corporate Hierarchy]] because of corporations' defiance of UAS laws. Although the UAS has never openly fought the corporations, it does occasionally supply ships and weapons to the enemies of the Hierarchy.

The UAS has founded many colonies in [[Human Space]], principally in the [[Kibo star system]].

== Ship Designs ==
UAS ships are designed for use in asteroid fields and so they are generally slow and bulky but well-armored. The Borer class is the basic workhorse for miners.

Another popular design is the Zulu-class gunship, which is light and maneuverable and ideal for cheap defenses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 2194, the [[Urak system]] was colonized by Russian exiles from [[Earth]] and [[Luna]]. The colonies prospered in the first half of the twenty-third century, mostly on the strength of [[ceralloy]] prices.

In 2247, an outbreak of [[phobos aerium]] decimated the population. With many other systems occupied by war, few were able to help the Urak and the system descended into chaos.

In 2276, one warlord clan triumphed over the others and imposed a strict military order in the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When the [[Corporate Hierarchy]] put out bids to build a new cruiser, the [[Makayev Corporation]] designed a heavy cruiser codenamed &quot;Omsk&quot;. Makayev, not generally known for starship design, had a lot to prove and the Omsk was a very ambitious design. In the end, technical problems led to the cancelation of the project, but not before Makayev spent billions of credits.

Fortunately, Makayev was able to salvage some of the components, and the innovative [[Omsk defense system]] is an offshoots of the original project.

==Ideas==
* Who won the bid to create the Corporate Cruiser? Probably Taikon or Bushido. Perhaps Makayev feels a bitter rivalry.
* Perhaps a prototype of the Omsk was built; it would probably be a monstrosity, like a scaled up [[Manticore]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Honoku Corporation started in 2162 as an importer of low-cost goods for the growing population of the [[Incandescent]] colony. By 2230, Honoku had diversified to become a manufacturer of consumer goods, industrial equipment, and space systems.

After the [[Syrtis War]], Honoku merged with Tomashi Star Systems, a designer and manufacturer of military starships and weapon systems. Throughout the 2300’s Honoku-Tomashi grew by forming ownership relationships with various smaller companies across [[Human Space]]. It allied with [[InfoNet Publishing]] in 2301, with [[Bushido Corporation]] in 2334, and with [[Habitat Holdings]] in 2340.

== History ==
The Iocrym are an ancient, alien race that visited [[Human Space]] in 2363. They are one of four ancient races that serve as guardians of the Galaxy. The Iocrym race guards the periphery and often deals with internal issues, such as first contact with intelligent species. In their racial hierarchy, which is difficult to understand, the Iocrym are associated with ice and stasis.

Although rumors of alien ships began almost as soon as humans left Earth, the first confirmed sighting of an alien vessel occurred in the Sanctuary star system when a freighter captain ran across a small fleet of Iocrym sentinels.

Soon afterwards, the Iocrym ships reached [[St. Katharine's Star]] and began a series of communication attempts. The Iocrym mastered human language after a few weeks—although some experts believe that Iocrym AIs are translating human language for the Iocrym.

After a brief exchange of information, which yielded many technological advances, the Iocrym proceeded towards [[Sol]].

A similar exchange of information occurred with experts in Sol. The Iocrym were particularly interested in human history, spending much time trying to understand the sequence of events that led to humans leaving our native solar system.

In 2364, the Iocrym left Human Space and have yet to return.

The ferromagnetic properties of this alloy interfere will most force fields, including those produced by shield generators. Because of this incompatibility, most starship manufacturers abandoned the use of meteorsteel.

He is smart, just, and brave, and has led the Fleet with distinction, especially through the last, difficult decade. Decker is admired throughout the Fleet by both officers and enlisted, and though there is much dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war, most of the anger is directed at the [[Commonwealth]] leadership in [[St. Katharine’s]]. Admiral Decker demands loyalty most of all from his Fleet—mistakes and other weaknesses can be forgiven and corrected, but he will not forget treachery. His greatest fear is that the Commonwealth leadership will tire of the [[Ares War|war]] and abandon the [[Outer Realm]] and the Fleet to the mercy of the Ares.

Let's face it: most people don't consider interplanetary shipping to be a sexy occupation. 3DV catalogs are filled with the exploits of the Fleet or even the Commonwealth Militia, but (other than the fringe series 'Antares Heavy') no one chronicles the day-to-day challenges of the freighter captain or the men and women who keep it safe.

That's a shame because the life of a freighter escort captain can be very exciting. In the less-populated systems of the New Beyond, the dangers from pirates and outlaws can be extreme. Fighting off a wave of Corsair-class gunships while defending a 12-kiloton freighter requires sharp skills and a strong protective instinct. And the pay is pretty good too.

The Korolov Shipping Corporation is the largest (and oldest) shipping company in Human Space. They have some of the most experienced escort pilots and are trusted by all the Commonwealth to ship expensive goods anywhere.

If you want to be an escort pilot for Korolov (and who wouldn't?) you'll want to make sure that you and your ship are ready. Lasers are probably your best option against the kinds of threats that you'll encounter, the bigger the better. But don't neglect your shields: Sometimes you'll need to interpose yourself between the freighter you're protecting and an incoming missile.

To be a successful escort pilot you also need to do some planning before you go out. The more valuable the cargo, the more powerful the threat against it. Don't accept a request to escort a cargo load beyond your abilities. At the same time, managers at Korolov like their escort pilots to have wide-ranging experience; Make sure you escort a variety of freighters, from the tiny EI100s to the massive Antares Vs.

So if you think you've got what it takes, visit the nearest Korolov Shipping station and ask for a mission.

== Miscellaneous ==
* One of the largest corporations in Human Space; their freighters can be seen anywhere from Starton Eridani to St. Katharine's Star all the way out to Sol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protons, neutrons, and electrons, the constituents of ordinary matter, have associated antiparticles with the same mass but opposite electric charge. When these antiparticles form antiatoms, they are known as antimatter.

When matter and antimatter meet, they anihilate and release immense quantities of energy. This property can be used to generate power or to create formidable weapons.

== Antimatter Power ==
Antimatter reactors are simple: any quantity of antimatter will generate immense energy when in contact with ordinary matter. The problem has always been obtaining the antimatter fuel—Earth contains no deposits of antimatter minerals.

As humans explored other worlds, however, minerals that contained antimatter particles were soon found. [[Pteracnium]] is one of the most common sources of antimatter. [[Xenotite]] and [[chronimium]] are other common sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An asteroid mine is a structure, often inhabited, desiged to mine valuable ores and mineral from asteroids.

== Unlicensed Mines ==
Unlicensed asteroid mines can be found in many [[Commonwealth]] systems. These wildcat operations avoid both [[Corporate]] profit-sharing and Commonwealth taxes. In exchange, however, they need to defend themselves against both rival miners and the [[Commonwealth Militia]].

Although the [[mining lasers]] on [[Borer-class]] ships are a powerful deterrent, unlicensed miners often hire mercenaries for additional protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Energy permeates the universe, and even the most perfect vacuum is filled with virtual energy from quantum fluctuations. This energy, known as zero-point energy, can, in principle, be tapped for useful purposes.

Since the twenty second century, scientists have been able to extract zero-point energy from [[hadron archeolith]] using an exotic vacuum state as a ground level.

The [[Commonwealth]] currently does not have any working zero-point energy reactors. [[Ringers]], however, have been able to harness this energy in limited ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve">United African Shipyards, located in the [[Kibo]] star system, is the [[UAS]]-owned shipyards monopoly. Founded in 2058 in [[Earth]] orbit, the United African Shipyard moved to the Kibo star system soon after it was colonized.

Though not known for particularly innovative designs, the United African Shipyards has produced some of the most popular ship classes in Human Space. Most of their designs are rugged and reliable.

Most ship classes are named after African tribes.

== Mining Ship Designs ==
The United African Shipyards are the acknowledged experts in mining ship design, an understandable accomplishment given the fact that so much of the UAS economy is based on asteroid mining. The ''[[Borer (ship class)|Borer]]'' class is the basic workhorse for miners. Other mining ship classes include the ''Bantu'' class and the ''Pangwe'' class.

== Gunship Designs ==
The UAS has created a wide variety of gunship designs and many are still being used by local militias or outlaw groups. The ''[[Zulu (ship class)|Zulu]]'' class is one of the oldest designs still in service.

Other classes include the ''Ashanti'', ''Dogon'', ''Kikuyu'', ''Oromo'', ''Sotho'', ''Upale'', and ''Wutu''.

== Capital Ship Designs ==
Capital ship classes are named after mountains of Africa: ''Uhuro'', ''Kilimajaro'', ''Kirinyaga'', ''Mikeno'', and ''Gahinga''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Order of Saint Bennin is an order of the [[Church of the Sisters of Domina]]. It is the most selfless and sacrificial of all the sects.

== Ideas ==
The monasteries of this order will always provide free fuel to any traveler and ask only for a voluntary donation. Sometimes, however, they run out of fuel because Marauders and others take advantage of their hospitality. Perhaps the player can make sure that only the truly needed are helped.

The player is free to pay anything she wishes for the fuel (including nothing). The more fuel she takes without paying, the more the surrounding stations (e.g., habitats and slums) suffer. But if she pays more money for fuel, the surrounding stations prosper. Also, there are Marauders around that steal the fuel. If the player destroys them, there is more fuel for everyone and the stations prosper.

The player gets no benefit from this, but there is a display at the Order that tells the player the conditions of the surrounding people.

== Mysteries ==
Is there a connection between Saint Bennin and the Bennin Xenophobes? Perhaps Saint Bennin helped to create the Xenophobes and now he has repented. Or perhaps both came from the same station/culture/environment.

The formulation is patented and sold under license only to the wealthiest members of the [[Commonwealth]] and [[Corporate Hierarchy]]. It is believed that a full, legal course of cancer dust treatments is sold for at least one million credits, depending on the assets of the patient.

There are various illegal, reverse-engineered versions of cancer dust, most distributed by the [[Death Drugs Cartel]].

Biological entities cannot become citizens of the CDM although they are often used as contract labor to maintain the cyberspace nodes.

The CDM has immense knowledge of neural networks, and artificial intelligence. Almost any computational problem can be solved faster and more accurately by the CDM. Because the citizens of the CMD have no material needs except for energy, they tend to value information above all else. For example, the CDM generally accepts a recorded neural pattern as payment for their services.

Dark matter interacts only weakly with the electromagnetic force and the nuclear-weak force.

There are four kinds of dark matter: dark acid, dark steel, dark lightning and dark fire.

Human technology is too primitive to manipulate dark matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Death Drugs Cartel sells the genetically tailored drugs needed for hyper-clonal therapy, a life-prolongation treatment. The drugs, which must be created specifically for an individual’s genome, were outlawed in the twenty-third century (in the middle of the [[Syrtis War]]) because their manufacture involves the growth and exploitation of a genetically altered, ancephalic clone. Though unavailable to the general [[Commonwealth]], it is well-known that most people of wealth and power use these drugs to prolong their life.

No one knows how long a human life may be extended using this therapy, but many people believe that the original creators of death drugs are still alive and are running the Cartel. If so, they would be over two-hundred years old.

== Organization ==
The Death Drugs Cartel is led by the secretive [[Cartel Directorate]], which is said to reside in a hidden station inside of [[Human Space]]. The Directorate controls five regions, each region organized by a Cartel Lieutenant in a well-defended stronghold. The Lieutenant has control over the labs and distribution networks for each star system in the region. Individual base commanders has jurisdiction over specific stations and labs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">After the defeat of the [[Syrtis Conclave]], the remains of the Ares Sect moved out to the [[Outer Realm]] to rebuild their empire. Using cloning and genetic engineering they have become a major power in a little over a century.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The current war between the [[Commonwealth]] and the [[Ares Orthodoxy]] is known as the Ares War. The war began in the 2340s and has seen periods of intense fighting amid many years of relative calm. Since 2416, the Ares have begun a new wave of attacks and both sides have intensified the pace of operations.

== History of the Ares War ==
The war began in early 2342 as both Ares colonies and Commonwealth settlers claimed the same systems in the [[Outer Realm]]. Negotiations between Commonwealth and Ares failed after a few months and Ares ships began attacking Commonwealth settlements. Throughout the 2340s, the Commonwealth evacuated several settlements in the disputed area while simultaneously building up its military capabilities.

In 2352, the Commonwealth stronghold of [[Point Vesta]] was completed in a disputed system near Ares space. [[Point Ceres]], [[Point Pallas]], and [[Point Juno]] were completed in other systems over the next five years. In 2353, the first [[Commonwealth star carrier]], the [[CSC Europa]] was launched and deployed to the war zone. Eleven more star carriers were built and deployed by 2357.

In 2372 and ’73, the Ares responded to this Commonwealth build-up by launching a massive attack using their (then new) Cometfall missileships. The attack failed to overcome the Commonwealth Fleet, but the Ares did destroy Point Vesta in 2372 and two star carriers in 2373.

For more than forty years after 2373, the Ares War remained stalemated. Occasional battles flared in the disputed zone, but few systems turned. The Ares used these years to build up their fleet; their new Phobos-class dreadnoughts are generally considered to be superior to the aging CSCs.

In 2416 a new wave of Ares attacks began with a surprise attack on Point Pallas. After a massive battle, reportedly involving eight Phobos dreadnoughts and four CSCs, Point Pallas was destroyed and the Commonwealth Fleet forced to retreat.

As of 2419, the Ares War has intensified further and unconfirmed reports suggest that Point Ceres and at least one more star carrier have been destroyed.

== Opposition to the War and the Rogue Fleet ==
In the late 2390s, various antiwar parties in Parliament rose in popularity. A plurality of people in [[St. Katharine’s]] and the [[New Beyond]] support a withdrawal of the Fleet from the [[Outer Realm]].

Opposition to the Ares among Commonwealth settlers in the Outer Realm remains strong, but support for the Fleet continues to drop.

In 2398 a group of Commonwealth captains rebelled against the Fleet leadership and formed the so-called [[Rogue Fleet]]. Rogue ships prey on Ares and Commonwealth colonies alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Freeworlds are a loose association of stations and individuals that attempt to stay out of the mainstream corporate world of the [[Commonwealth]]. With their own industries and their own populations, the Freeworlds are independent enough that they do not participate in any of the economic structures of the [[Human Space]].

Philosophically, the Freeworlders have developed a blend of socialist and free market ideas that affirm individual rights over megacorporation hegemony. The moderate majority believes in co-existence with the rest of humanity and only conflicts with the Commonwealth over intellectual property rights (which the Freeworlders abhor). Nevertheless, there are radical elements (such as the [[Anarchists]]) who actively and violently seek to topple the [[Corporate Hierarchy]].

The most successful and the largest Freeworlds enterprise is the family-owned [[Revolution Designs Association]] which manufactures most everything from personal appliances to starships.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Freeworlds Shipyard is a communal shipyard that also serves as the public gathering place for all [[Freeworlders]] involved in space activities. Though mostly used by individuals to repair and retrofit their starships, the Freeworlds Shipyard also has a manufacturing plant run by the [[Revolution Designs Association]] that produces many good quality starships.

== Shuttle and Transport Designs ==
The vast majority of ships built by the Freeworlds Shipyard are small shuttles and transports. The following are some of the most common designs:

* [[Earthzone class shuttle]]
* Freespace 350 starrider (personal shuttle)
* Freespace 750 starrider (high-performance shuttle)
* Solidarity R5 transport
* Solidarity T51 light freighter

== Armed Ship Designs ==
Although Revolution Designs does not create nor endorse any military designs, many people have created modifications that include weapons and shields. All of the above designs have armed variants.

None of the species in this domain evolved naturally, but in the first orbis several other domains created self-replicating metallic creatures. Since then, most Ferroelectic species have evolved independently of their creators.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Human Space is the term used to describe the group of human-populated star systems centered on [[Sol]] and contained within the quarantine zone established by the [[Ancient Races]].

The star systems of Human Space are commonly divided into regions, each one colonized in a different wave of human expansion. Humanity's first interstellar colonies in the dozen systems around Sol are known are the [[Near Stars]]. These systems, colonized in the first decades of the twenty-second century, include [[Centauri]], [[Sirius]], and [[Kibo]].

The discovery of a biosphere on a world in [[Saint Katharine's Star]] sparked a new wave of colonization. By the twenty-fourth century, after the devastation of [[Earth]] and [[Mars]] in the [[Syrtis War]], Saint Katharine’s had become the political center of Human Space.

As the Saint Katharine's colonies grew and developed, various groups pushed further out into the [[New Beyond]]. The [[Commonwealth]] colonies of [[Rigel Aurelius]] and [[Eridani]] were founded in the late twenty-second century.

Meanwhile, other groups leapfrogged the New Beyond and settled in the systems around [[Jiang's Star]]. The [[Huari]] settled in the early twenty-second century, but were later displaced by the [[Sung]] civilization. Since the twenty-fourth century, the Sung have claimed dozens of systems as [[Sung Space]]. The Commonwealth, which also has colonies in the region, disputes the claim and instead calls the systems the [[Ungoverned Territories]].

In the late twenty-second century, [[Ringers]] from [[Saturn]] colonized many systems beyond Sung Space. This region, now known as the [[Outer Realm]], has only a small Commonwealth presence. After the resurgence of the [[Ares]] however, the Outer Realm has become the main battleground for Commonwealth and Ares forces.

The ancestors of the Huari settled in the [[Loriol system]] in the early 2120s. Later, they expanded into the surrounding systems and formed the Huari Empire.

The Huari are not as technologically advanced as the Sung—particularly with respect to cyber-technology. Nevertheless, their massive fortresses protect them from the Slavers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Corporate Hierarchy is older than the [[Commonwealth]]. It was founded originally in 2043 as a loose association of companies to coordinate the exploitation of space resources, but it has developed over the last few centuries into a fully functioning federated sovereign.

The members of the Hierarchy, known as shareholders, are all owners of shares in one of more corporations. Though nominally citizens of the Commonwealth, shareholders follow their own laws and processes when on private corporate territory. Though they are not obvert about it, shareholders think of themselves are superior (or at least luckier) than the average Commonwealth citizen.

Most shareholders own shares in a single corporation—generally the corporation in which they work. Transferring from one corporation to another is not unheard of, but it is about as difficult as moving from America to Europe was in the twentieth century. Most shareholders feel a strong loyalty to their corporation primarily.

== Leadership ==
Despite its name, the Corporate Hierarchy is extremely decentralized. Each corporation has a wide degree of autonomy in how it conducts its business. Each corporation is governed by a Board of Directors that is (generally) elected by the shareholders (with votes proportional to their shares).

Inter-corporate affairs, trading rules, and common security bylaws are decided by the Corporate Organizing Committee, which consists of a member from each chartered corporation (who has votes proportional to market capitalization).

A second body, the Corporate Executive Committee, wields the power to enforce laws and regulations between corporations and the power to enforce trade agreements and treaties with external entities.

The Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is a small and secretive body consisting of some of the largest shareholders in the Hierarchy. The CEC consists of 17 members, but not all are publicly known, choosing to remain anonymous.

At least three and possibly as many as six current members of the CEC were alive at the original founding of the Hierarchy, more than 375 years ago.

In the 2180’s, Ringers unhappy with the economic situation in [[Sol]], began to colonize the [[Outer Realm]]. Today, only a small percentage of the Ringer population remain at Saturn.

Because of their adaptation to space, Ringers are expert and efficient miners and they supply heavy metals and radioactives to much of [[Human Space]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Syrtis Conclave originated on [[Mars]] during the twenty-second century. Their knowledge of genetic engineering and neural programming enabled them to create a population of neo-human clones. Over the many decades, the architects of the Conclave created a prosperous civilization free of dissent and division.

During the 2220's a sub-culture within the Conclave, known as the [[Ares Sect]], rose to power and assumed control over the entire Conclave. Guided by what they believed to be a divine intelligence in the [[Galactic Core]], the [[Ares]] waged war on Earth and the surrounding systems. After attacking and destroying various Commonwealth colonies, the Commonwealth organized a fleet to defeat the Ares. The [[Commonwealth Fleet]] succeeded in destroying the Ares fleet and nearly sterilized Mars from orbit with fusion weapons. The remaining survivors were driven out of the system.

Today the Ares have re-established their civilization in the [[Outer Realm]], and the Commonwealth Fleet continues to [[Ares War|fight]] them there. The Syrtis Conclave also remains as a nomadic diaspora that has small colonies in various human star systems. Even there, they tend to populate the outer asteroids or inhospitable worlds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Johann Amundsen was a miner and explorer who discovered many of the asteroids in the systems of the [[New Beyond]] and who gained immense power and wealth from his discovery of an alien data store.

He was born in 2163 and moved with his family to [[Starton Eridani]] when he was a teenager.

In 2221, on an expedition to a distant star system, he found a buried alien archive. Amundsen used the knowledge that he found inside to plan and execute several expeditions, each one further and further from [[Human Space]]. Each time he returned, he brought back fabulous riches and technologies. But he also returned altered—Amundsen had used the alien knowledge to enhance his ship and himself.

The last time that he returned, in 2229, he was almost unrecognizable. He had attained powers far beyond any human. A massive Commonwealth fleet was deployed to prevent Amundsen from getting too close to a populated area. He spoke for several days with high-level representatives and scientists of the Commonwealth, but the transcripts of those conversations were marked Highest Security and have to this date not been made public. A few days later he left Human Space and has not returned since.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anton is a wealthy, high-placed Corporate director who seeks to gain power. [[Oracus]] influences him and helps him on occasion. As the player gains more power, she may attract Anton’s attention. Whenever the player gains some powerful or unique technology, Anton will seek to acquire it (at a decent, but not generous price). If the player refuses, Anton may use other forms of persuasion. He may try to hurt the player by draining her credit or perhaps by blacklisting her from all Corporate stations. If that doesn’t work, he will send out bounty-hunters against her. As a last resort, if the prize is sufficient (e.g., an archcannon) then he will fight directly.

Construction at Polyarny began in 2263, only a few years after the end of the [[Syrtis War]]. The first shipyard was completed in 2266, and the first ship built there was launched in 2269.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Urak is a star system a few gates away from [[Sol]]. It is member of the [[Near Stars]].

== History ==
In 2194, the Urak system was colonized by Russian exiles from [[Earth]] and [[Luna]]. The colonies prospered in the first half of the twenty-third century, mostly on the strength of [[ceralloy]] prices.

In 2247, an outbreak of [[phobos aerium]] decimated the population. With many other systems occupied by war, few were able to help the Urak and the system descended into chaos.

In 2276, one warlord clan triumphed over the others and imposed a strict military order in the system.

After the devastation suffered on [[Earth]] and [[Mars]] by the war, many believed that humankind was not worthy to leave its own solar system. The Order of Penitence began as campaign of voluntary extinction in which members foreswore the right to have children. Although it never reached mass appeal, the Order attracted extremists who twisted its charter to include forced human extinction.

      <comment>/* Selected Civilizations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This article is about the origins for the civilizations of the Galaxy.

In the history of the Galaxy seventeen species independently evolved intelligence and civilization. Every one of the thousands of civilizations in the Galaxy emerged from one of those seventeen. No one knows which one was first to emerge--the history of the first civilizations are lost in time. The most recent emergence, the seventeenth species, is humanity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term ''Ancient Races'' refers to the civilizations that currently inhabit the galactic disk.

== History ==
At the end of the [[Galactic Civil War]] the surviving species agreed that unchecked growth (both in numbers and in technology) was unsustainable. [[Oracus]] and [[Domina]] restricted the powers of each species to a well-defined limit. Furthermore, every species was responsible for limiting its use of energy, which required each to implement reproductive controls and enforce a limited lifespan.

To safeguard this new peace and to enforce the limits, Oracus and Domina chose individuals from each species and gave them special powers, including immortality. These individuals are known as [[Archons]] and they were chosen and created to both represent and to control the particular species they came from.

== Domains ==
Like all lifeforms in the galaxy, the Ancient Races belong to one of the nine [[domains of life]]:

* [[Carbosilicate (domain)|Carbosilicate]]: rock and crystalline creatures.
* [[Ferroelectric (domain)|Ferroelectric]]: cybernetic and metallic lifeforms.
* [[Hydrogenia (domain)|Hydrogenia]]: large, gas giant inhabitants.
* [[Monomorphia]]: massive single organisms similar to fungi.
* [[Nebular (domain)|Nebular]]: rarefied beings consisting of interacting dust motes in nebulae.
* [[Neutronia]]: hyperdense organisms living on white dwarfs and neutron stars.
* [[Oxygenia]]: carbon-based, oxygen breathers, human-scale.
* [[Photosynthic]]: photosynthetic life.
* [[Transcendent (domain)|Transcendent]]: non-baryonic lifeforms like Domina and Oracus.

== Aspects &amp; Alignments ==
Each of the Ancient Races has its own philosophy, heritage, and culture. Each values different things and each strives for different things. While each species is unique, it is possible to categorize them. Each species can be rated along three ''aspects'':

* community vs. independence
* knowledge vs. spirituality
* evolution vs. tradition

From these axes we can construct eight [[alignments]] that correspond to various combinations of the aspects:

* [[Republic]] (community, knowledge, evolution): Republics are often homogenous civilizations with a well-defined hierarchical government. They value knowledge, reason, and facts, but they acknowledge that nothing stays the same and continually try to improve themselves.

* [[Federation]] (community, knowledge, tradition): These civilizations, often composed of diverse peoples, have achieved balance and peace over several millenia. They rely on their great stores of knowledge to guide their decisions and they tend to be suspicious of innovation because of the risk of unintended consequences.

* [[Uplifter]] (community, spirituality, evolution): Uplifter civilizations believe in continuously improving themselves and those around them. Their sacred mission is to make the universe better for all its sentient beings. Their one flaw is that they sometimes lack patience.

* [[Foundation]] (community, spirituality, tradition): Foundations strive to be selfless civilizations that support the development of others. They are like the solid core around which a gas giant forms. Foundations preserve the infrastructure, keep the peace, maintain trade, and otherwise serve to bind other civilizations together.

* [[Competitor]] (independence, knowledge, evolution): Competitor civilizations idealize the individual who competes, excels, and triumphs. They value the process of competition almost more than the result. Anywhere in the universe is home for these beings and the only thing they fear is boredom.

* [[Archivist]] (independence, knowledge, tradition): Archivists value the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge. The hard-won insights of long-dead races hold more interest to these civilizations than either conquest or treasure.

* [[Seeker]] (independence, spirituality, evolution): These civilizations are composed of diverse individuals who worship open-mindedness and questioning. Through art, philosophy and religion, Seekers strive to give meaning and sense to a cold and irrational universe.

* [[Hermit]] (independence, spirituality, tradition): Hermit civilizations concentrate on the simplicity of existing. They believe that desire leads to obsession which leads to unhappiness. Only by accepting the universe as it is can an intelligent creature be truly enlightened.

All of the above civilizations are ''constructive'' in that they generally coexist with each other peacefully. There are, however, ''destructive'' versions of all the above that are corrupted or extremist. Destructive civilizations are not uncommon, but they are often contained to certain regions or otherwise managed.

The destructive alignments are:

* [[Collective]] (corrupted republic): Taken to an extreme, a homogenous society can become an unthinking mass controlled by a central ruler.

* [[Empire]] (corrupted federation): Whereas federations are voluntary associations of diverse groups, empires seek to conquer and expand.

* [[Sterilizer]] (corrupted uplifter): Sterilizers and uplifters have a similar goal: to create a better universe. Sterilizers destroy flawed cultures rather than help to improve them.

* [[Corrector]] (corrupted foundation): While foundations support civilization, correctors can stifle it. Correctors impose their own byzantine rules, regulations, and mores on all.

* [[Megalomaniac]] (corrupted competitor): The dark side of competion leads to this alignment, in which belief in superiority leads to destructive ends.

* [[Cryptologue]] (corrupted archivist): Cryptologues horde knowledge and use it to achieve their own dark goals. They often prevent the dissemination of knowledge to others.

* [[Perversion]] (corrupted seeker): Unbound by logic, perversions become obsessed by paranoid theories and destructive ideals. These are some of the most chaotic and unpredictable civilizations.

* [[Solipsist]] (corrupted hermit): Solipsist civilizations believe that nothing matters except what happens in their own mind. Though often harmless they can cause great suffering because they never worry about the consequences of their actions.

== Technology ==
There are six broad classes of [[Galactic technology]], each corresponding to a particular philosophy. Each of the Ancient Races generally uses a single class. Within a class, technological artifacts and knowledge are compatible with each other. Not so across classes.

The six classes are:

* [[Megatech]]: The technology of terraforming and creating megastructures such as world-ships, associated with the community aspect.
* [[Recyclist]]: The technology based on gluing together various bits of other technologies, associated with the independence aspect.
* [[Mechanist]]: The technology of machines and cybernetics, associated with the knowledge aspect.
* [[Psionic]]: The technology based on conscious energy, associated with the spirituality aspect. (This technology does not have physical star-travel.)
* [[Biotech]]: The technology of life (generally carbon-based), associated with the evolution aspect.
* [[Archeotech]]: The technology based on precursor civilizations such as the [[Majellen]], associated with the tradition aspect.

== Population ==
There is a wide distribution of population sizes among the Ancient Races. A few races have more than 10 trillion individuals; many have less than 10 million. This table shows the rough distribution:

|}

=== Savage and Cultured Civilizations ===
Over time, civilizations chafed under the population controls and many openly subverted them. The Archons, in concert with Oracus and Domina, separated them into two classes. ''Savage'' civilizations were allowed to reproduce at will, but were not protected from predation or even sport. In contrast, ''cultured'' civilizations maintained their original population limits but were protected from harm by the Archons.

Most of the constructive civilizations are cultured, while most (but not all) of the destructive civilizations are savage.

== Primary Races ==
There are more than a thousand different races in the galaxy; these are the most common and numerous:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Civilizations can be categorized into groups based on their beliefs and values. One such method of categorization is called ''alignment''.

Perpetual optimists, the Erebien strive to perfect their civilization in a galaxy that often seems illogical.

Though they are a relatively young race, they have the respect of their elders, a fact which annoys their sibling race, the [[Tor Quan]].

== History ==
The Erebien emerged from the [[Daazhen]] after the end of the [[Oracus War]].

== Biology ==
Exoskeletal, human-sized; they appear as a head on top of four multi-jointed limbs, each of which can serve as either leg or arm.

== Economy ==

== Language &amp; Culture ==

== Key Places ==

== Sects &amp; Organizations ==
=== Archons ===
The Archons of the Erebien are very involved in the civilization.

=== Erebien Military ===
The defenders of the Erebien.

== Stations &amp; Starships ==

== Allies &amp; Enemies ==
=== Humanity ===
The Erebien want to spare humanity. They regret that the [[Anunnaki]] were exterminated and feel that they could have done better. They dismiss the [[Iocrym]] and the [[Cenotropes]] as backward-looking.

=== Tor Quan ===
The [[Tor Quan]] are the Erebien's brother species and they have always had a competitive relationship with them.

=== Conflict with the [[Reenu]] ===
The [[Reenu]] have an expansionist empire that often encroaches on Erebien systems. Though the conflict has endured since the founding of the Reenu Empire it has increased in intensity in the last few trisems. Some believe the Reenu can no longer be contained and must be exterminated, though the Erebien archons do not agree.

=== Conflict with the [[Jax]] ===
The [[Jax]] are an intelligent predator species that mainly hunt the [[Efreet]] and their interests. The Erebien, though sometimes a target, try to contain the Jax to help the Efreet (whom they consider a strong ally).

=== Conflict with the [[Grome]] ===
The Erebien have a complicated relationship with the [[Grome]]. Though they officially disapprove of the Grome's expansionist behavior, the Erebien find the Grome useful when they threaten the [[Tor Quan]].

== History ==
The Reenu were created by [[Onawa]], an ancient [[Perversion]], now extinct.

== Notes ==
* The Reenu (like many savage races) are cyclical. They grow in numbers until they become a threat or outstrip their environment; then they collapse. The Reenu are on an up cycle and have one of the largest populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A republic is an [[alignment]] of Galactic civilization characterized by the aspects of community, knowledge, and evolution.

== Community ==
Republics have a high-degree of social cohesion. The individuals of a republic feel that they are part of something greater and willingly sacrifice some personal gain for the good of the civilization. Whereas [[federations]] achieve social cohesion through a complex balance of power among disparate groups, republics tend to have a homogenous population that shares many key values.

In some cases this homogeneity leads to a belief in the civilization's superiority over others; in extreme cases it can turn into xenophobia.

== Knowledge ==
Republics generally believe in the importance of science and objective knowledge.

== Evolution ==
Republican society is seldom static; republics strive to improve their civilization and adapt it to a changing universe.

Republics often rank themselves against other civilizations, believing that some civilizations are better than others according to concrete and measurable criteria. Some republics distrust civilizations that cling to their past traditions, but most are inward-focused.

== Technology ==
Republics tend to adopt [[biotech]], [[mechanist]], or [[megatech]] technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article lists the different methods for generating power:

; [[Antimatter]] : Antimatter power involves the regulated combination of matter and antimatter. Antimatter fuel can be obtained from [[chronimium]], [[pteracnium]], and [[xenotite]].

; [[Combustion]] : One of the most primitive sorts of power generation, this method creates heat by rapid oxydization of some fuel. This is the principal behind hydrocarbon power generation as well as the chemical process of species of the [[oxygenia]] domain.

; [[Dark energy]] : This mysterious power source is available only to [[archons]], [[hierodules]], and [[Domina]] &amp; [[Oracus]].

; [[Gravitic energy]] : Gravitic energy can be harvested at large-scale around neutron stars and black holes. At small-scale it is possible to use [[nanosingularities]] in a [[pseudocore]] armature to generate power.

; [[Nuclear fission]] : Power generation through splitting heavy elements. This process requires fuels like [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]].

; [[Nuclear fusion]] : Power generation through fusing of light elements. This process requires some heavy isotopes of hydrogen and helium. [[Helium regolith]] is a common raw material.

; [[Preon energy]] : Some of the [[Ancient Races]] have developed technology to split protons and neutrons into their constituent quarks.

; [[Solar power]] : This method converts photons into energy; this is the primary power generation method of [[photosynthic]] species. Some human sovereigns and alien species build large-scale structure to harness solar power.

; [[Zero-point energy]] : This method uses [[hadron archeolith]] as fuel and exotic vacuums as a ground-state.

      <text xml:space="preserve">OmniDefense Systems (ODS) is a medium-sized corporation specializing in the manufacture of [[autons]]. They are a subsidiary of [[Earth Industries Conglomerate]].

ODS started manufacturing autons for Corporate defense in the late 2290’s. Though they did not invent the concept of an autonomous escort ship, they were the first to perfect the sophisticated algorithms required. Previous models had suffered from glitches that sometimes led to friendly-fire incidents.

In 2386, ODS began selling a version of their low-end defense auton to consumers interested in personal defense. Although initially controversial, sales of this consumer model far exceeded expectations.

In 2389, ODS produced the first AutoSentinel model, and since that time ODS has derived more than half its revenue from consumer sales.

OmniDefense Systems was purchased by Earth Industries in a hostile takeover in 2391.

The war ended in 2251 after Commonwealth forces entered the Sol system and nuked Mars from orbit. It remains the bloodiest and most destructive conflict in human history, resulting in hundreds of millions of deaths, massive damage to all of Earth's major cities, and the destruction of the Syrtis civilization.

== Causes of the War ==
{Resentment over the gene crisis; rise of the Ares Sect; etc.}
